            <p>It was the <state>North Dakota</state>license plates that immediately stood
                out to the Thunderchilds. </p>
            <section>
                <p> Sixteen-year-old <person>Prairiedawn Thunderchild</person>and her 13-year-old
                    younger sister,<person>Tah’nee</person>, were walking to their apartment in
                    northern <city>Wolf Point</city>on Aug. 1, 2018. The evening was
                    warm and sticky as they tend to be in the late summer, but the sky was clear as
                    the girls walked past Southside Elementary School. </p>
                <p> Then a light blue car containing two men, who the girls would later describe as
                    “non-white,” slowly sidled up alongside. </p>
                <p> This is not necessarily an odd thing. <city>Wolf Point </city>is the largest
                    town in the <res>Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeast Montana</res>. The
                    reservation of mostly Assiniboine and Dakota members covers more than 2 million
                    acres, but <city>Wolf Point</city> has a population of approximately 2,700
                    people. And like many small towns with largely Native American communities,
                    friends and family bonds are strong. </p>
                <p>
                    <!-- create a person, officals, tribal police att. -->
                    <!-- create a cityography personoraphy orgoraphy-->
                    <q person="#">“My kids know everybody,”</q> said their mother, 39-year-old
                        <person>Katie Thunderchild</person>, who was in the nearby town of
                        <city>Poplar</city> that evening. <q person="#">“We go to a lot of community
                        things. We know.”</q>
                </p>
                <p>However, there is a shadow cast over the region, perhaps one that had the sisters
                    hypervigilant, suspicious of anyone, especially with those license plates.</p>
                <p>“When I saw the <state>North Dakota</state> plates, it made me think it was
                    ‘mancamp’ or from the oil workers,” <person>Prairiedawn Thunderchild
                    </person>said, pronouncing both words of the term mashed into one. <q>“What was
                        going through my mind was they would go and do things to me, or that I would
                        never see my family.”</q></p>
                <p>Although the men in the car were never caught, the three Thunderchilds are
                    certain of two things: The men in the blue car intended to do the sisters harm,
                    and the <state>North Dakota</state> plates meant the strangers likely came from
                    laborer lodging facilities on nearby oil fields — man camps — in
                        <manCamp>Williston</manCamp> and <manCamp>Watford
                        City</manCamp>. Both towns are near the site of an oil boom that
                    started in 2006 and peaked in 2012. A perceived increase in violent crime has
                    been present ever since.</p>
                <p>So, the sisters ran. They ran to a nearby park while Tah’nee Thunderchild made
                    the call to local city police, the <org>Wolf Point Police </org>Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <q person="#">“We had to run,” she told dispatch, “because the guys got out and
                        they told us to get in their car. We had to run.”</q>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>According to the police report, <person>Officer Tyler Osborne </person>escorted
                    the girls home, but he was unable to locate the men in the light blue vehicle
                    with the <state>North Dakota </state>plates. <person>Katie
                    Thunderchild</person>even picked up the search herself.</p>
                <p><q person="#">“My mother instinct was, ‘What? Let’s go find it,’”</q> she said.
                    “Every blue car that drove by… but we couldn’t find anything.” </p>
                <p><q person="#">“You see people around here you’ve never seen before,”</q>
                    <person>Katie Thunderchild </person>said. </p>
                <p> Laborer lodging facilities have become a necessity for massive energy
                    development projects, which tend to create booms in both economy and population
                    for small, rural towns. They have also become a common core concern in light of
                    the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women crisis, as the cause for much of the
                    victimization of Native American women across the country. </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>This idea isn’t entirely ill-founded. According to the <org>Sovereign Bodies
                        Institute</org>, there are currently four missing and 12 murdered Native
                    American women from the <res>Fort Peck Indian Reservation</res>, though numbers
                    are almost certainly higher, as many go unreported. A 2019 study from the
                        <org>U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics</org>described a 23 percent increase
                    of violent crime in the Bakken oil region during 2006 to 2012, while regions
                    outside it dropped 8 percent.</p>
                <p> These numbers coincide with the already high rates of violence against Native
                    American women. According to a five-year study released in 2018 by the
                        <org>National Congress of American Indians</org>, 55 percent of Native
                    American women have experienced violence from an intimate partner in their
                    lifetime.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>The picture of man camps many hold is often frightening. Dozens, sometimes
                    hundreds, of men seeking high wages crammed into a tessellation of hastily built
                    shelters, barely supervised and as close to the stereotypical lawless “Wild
                    West” as it gets. They are seen as hubs for drugs, human trafficking and
                    violence, an image the facility administrators try to avoid.</p>
                <p><q person="#">“We don’t even call ourselves a man camp,”</q> said
                        <person>E.J. Ross</person>, an office administrator at <manCamp>Aries
                        Residence Suites</manCamp>, a lodging facility in <city>Watford, North
                        Dakota</city>. <q>“The association with that name conjures up visions
                        that, I don’t care how good of a marketer you are, you say ‘man camps’
                        people have one mindset.”</q></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>As the <org>Keystone XL </org>oil pipeline inches ever closer to reality, so does
                    a man camp in <city>Nashua, Montana</city> near the <res>Fort Peck Indian
                        Reservation’s</res> southwest border. This stokes fears among the tribal
                    communities that the number of crimes against the tribe’s women will only
                    increase.</p>
                <p><org>Fort Peck Tribal Executive Board </org>member <person>Marva Chapman
                    </person>underlined these concerns: “The bottom line is a pipeline is
                    contaminating to our water and to our people.”</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>A study released in 2016 by the <org>Montana Board of Crime Control Statistical
                        Analysis Center</org> and the <org>University of Montana’s Criminology
                        Research Group</org>revealed members of the community felt most unsafe in
                        <county>Roosevelt</county> and <county>Richland</county> counties. More than
                    75 percent of <county>Roosevelt County</county>lies within <res>Fort Peck Indian
                        Reservation </res>and contains <city>Wolf Point</city>and
                        <city>Poplar</city>. Richland holds the town of <city>Sidney,
                    Montana</city>, the home of <person>Sherry Arnold</person>.</p>
                <p>For many non-Native Americans outside the <res>Fort Peck Reservation</res>,
                    Arnold’s death provided their first introduction to the dark underbelly of oil
                    booms and the influx of outsiders who arrive to take advantage of them.</p>
                <p>Arnold was a well-respected high school teacher in Sidney, roughly 50 miles from
                    both the <res>Fort Peck Indian Reservation </res>and <manCamp>Williston’s own
                        man camp</manCamp>. After disappearing in January 2012, her remains were
                    found more than two months later near the North Dakota town, an area in the
                    midst of an economic and population upswing due to energy development. Arnold’s
                    killer — Colorado’s <person>Lester Van Waters Jr.</person>— previously told
                    family and friends he was in the region to seek work on the Bakken oil
                    fields.</p>
                <p>Unchecked growth and the outsiders who come with it inflamed a common fear among
                    surrounding communities: the oil boom and violent crime were linked.</p>
                <p>“You can go on Facebook, you can go on social media, you can find news reports,
                    and a lot of that is personal and anecdotal,” said <org>Missoula Urban Indian
                        Health Center’s</org>Ivan MacDonald. “You know like, ‘My sister went to a
                    man camp to find work and was missing for months.’”</p>
                <p>MacDonald is part of a program focusing on holistic and culturally-based care. He
                    and his sister Ivy are also filmmakers working on their first feature-length
                    film dedicated to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous women crisis.</p>
                <p>MacDonald is hardly alone in his mission. <person>Activist Angeline Cheek
                    </person>is a <city>Wolf Point </city> resident and calls the
                    reservation home. The 30-year-old is an enrolled Dakota/Lakota tribal member and
                    has been a vocal opponent of energy development in and around tribal lands for
                    years, citing the trauma such projects can incite, both environmentally and
                    socially. She believes there is an unequivocal connection between man camps and
                    missing and murdered Native American women. Allowing for
                    their construction brings far more harm than good, she said. And people need to
                    know about it.</p>
            </section>
            <p><q person="#">“You have to know your role,”</q> she said. <q person="#"
                    >“My role is to educate the people.”</q></p>
            <p><org>The Red Bird Woman Center </org>in <city>Wolf Point
                </city>is also well-versed in dealing with trauma related to sexual and
                physical violence. It is not the easiest place to find. There are no large signs
                covering its nondescript outer walls, no flashy advertisements to draw people in.
                This is by design. The women and children who need this support don’t have to worry
                about their abusers stumbling into its otherwise welcoming doors. This covert
                attitude extends to the center’s employees, who all declined to have their picture
                taken. The risk of visual identification is just too great for the women to feel
                comfortable.</p>
            <p>The center has been in service since the 1980s, providing counseling, shelter, and
                domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse support. The women who run the center
                believe in the power of awareness and education as oil development springs up around
                    Native American communities, bringing with it all too
                familiar burdens.</p>
            <p><q person="#">“Indian country wasn’t prepared for such a boom,”</q> Crisis
                Counselor and Senior Family Support case manager <person>Ann Denny</person> said.
                    <q>“More traffic will bring more people who want to spend money and who will put
                    our women and kids in danger.”</q></p>
            <p>Family support case manager <person>Angela Kennedy </person>also believes
                higher numbers of outsiders with cash to burn spell trouble.</p>
            <p><q person="#">“The people who work in the camps may not be safe people,”</q>
                she said. “They make a lot of money fast, and they don’t know what to do with
                it.”</p>
            <p>What they do with it, according to the <org>Red Bird Woman Center </org>, is funnel
                it into narcotics, particularly methamphetamine. Young women meet men from outside
                the Indian communities and become addicted to substances, at the mercy of those
                willing to exploit that for sexual purposes, Denny said.</p>
            <p>Violence against women is not the only issue facing reservation residents. There are
                concerns over water quality, drug and human trafficking and the environmental impact
                of adding more and more pipelines to the region. And with those, of course, come
                more man camps.</p>
            <img >
                <caption>The Aries Residence Suites lodging camp in
                        Waterford City N.D.  is made of dozens of rows of identical
                    buildings, which may have anywhere from one to six beds. In the surrounding
                    hills are the oil fields where most of the residents work during the
                    day.</caption>
            </img>
            <p>Entering the <manCamp>Bakken and Watford Place man camps</manCamp>, collectively
                known as<manCamp> Aries Residence Suites</manCamp> in <city>Watford City, North
                Dakota</city>, the first thing you notice is the mud. It’s a rusty orange slop peppered
                with equally rusty orange pebbles. It coats the roads that weave through the rows of
                identical mobile home-like structures and sticks to everything. It’s spattered up
                the sides of tenants’ cars, their boots, the modest landings in each doorway.</p>
            <p><manCamp>Aries Residence Suites </manCamp>can house 300 residents. The camp is
                located near North Dakota’s western border and about an hour and a half drive east
                from the limits of the <res>Fort Peck reservation</res>.</p>
            <p>The camp is surprisingly mute during the day. Laborers leave their rentals empty as
                they work in nearby old fields. As evening approaches, most head straight to their
                accommodations. A few stop by the main office briefly to pick up mail. A man, both
                his arms covered in tattoos, haggles with site supervisor <person>E.J. Ross</person>
                over rental pricing.</p>
            <p>The Bakken oil boom affected <city>Watford City
                </city>hard, with a population that soared from 1,744 in 2010 to 6,523 only
                seven years later. More than tripling in size puts a strain on any city, and men
                drawn by the promise of hard-earned oil money need places to stay. That’s where
                companies like Aries come in, providing support for a housing infrastructure that
                just couldn’t handle such explosive growth.</p>
            <p>Though painstaking efforts are taken to distance themselves from the <q person="#"
                    >“man camp”</q> label — these are <q person="#">“residence lodges,”</q> as Ross
                said — it is true areas like these are built mainly to take care of men working the
                nearby oil fields. But women and children are not forbidden from staying at Bakken
                Suites, said camp manager Jeni Belman. Belman lives in a private unit herself, as
                many Aries employees do.</p>
            <p>Aries contains temporary housing that can cost as little as $25 per night for the
                four-occupancy <q person="#">“dormitory style”</q> units with shared kitchen and
                living space. Those looking for something more private can even stay in <q
                    person="#">“executive suites,”</q> fully-private cabins with kitchen appliances
                costing $45 a night if staying for more than a month. With housekeeping and all
                utilities included in the price (and internet and T.V. to boot), it’s no wonder
                these arrangements have a widespread appeal.</p>
            <p><manCamp>Aries Residence Suites </manCamp>might be ritzier than any image the term <q
                    person="#">“man camp”</q> might engender — stereotypical magnets for criminals
                of all sorts, void of good intentions — but Ross believes there is some truth to the
                hype.</p>
            <p>Background checks are more “unofficial” than exhaustive, sometimes involving little
                more than a Facebook screening. Alcohol is allowed on-site, though guns are only
                relegated to tenants’ vehicles. Ross has personally had to step in on occasions men
                become <q person="#">“a little too fixated”</q> on female residents. And people are
                notoriously unpredictable.</p>
            <p>
                <q person="#">“You never know who you’re going to meet,” he said. “You don’t know
                    what’s on their mind.”</q>
            </p>
            <p><state>Eastern Montana</state> and <state>western North Dakota’s</state> isolation
                and “badlands” locale can also be attributed to an element of danger. It’s the sort
                of place drivers need to keep a close eye on their gas tanks; the next pump could be
                miles away. Something is bound to happen occasionally in a space that vast, Ross
                said. He recalls <q person="#">“six or seven”</q> instances of missing women cases
                in the last year.</p>
            <p><q person="#">“This is a state where people disappear,”</q> Ross said.</p>
            <p><person>Lieutenant Brian Erwin </person>of the <org>Wolf Point Police Department
                </org>isn’t so sure increased violent crime rates can be blamed entirely on oil
                development and man camps. Drugs, alcohol and the violence that accompanies such
                things have been issues on reservations for decades, he said.</p>
            <p><q person="#">“We don’t have to look for some crazy new reason when we know what goes
                    on,”</q> said Erwin, who has worked with the police department since 2000. “Why
                do the women who live here get victimized every damn day? Native American women are
                abused and neglected here on a daily basis from the earliest ages.” </p>
            <p><org>Fort Peck tribal police </org><person>Captain James Summers </person>is also
                reluctant to put too much focus on the introduction of man camps to the region.
                Summers has been a member of the tribal police for 27 years, and chief for five. He
                cuts an imposing figure, quiet-voiced but direct, even seated behind his desk at the
                    <org>Bureau of Indian Affairs building </org>in <city>Poplar</city>, 22 miles
                east of <city>Wolf Point</city>.</p>
            <p>Summers believes the Bakken oil boom is responsible for an explosion of narcotics,
                especially opioids, more than anything.</p>
            <p><q person="#">“It’s tough to say that domestic violence is influenced by the
                    Bakken,”</q> Summers said. “It’s always been a problem here. Whether or not it’s
                influenced by the Bakken, I don’t know.”</p>
            <p>But according to <person>Angeline Cheek</person>, the rates of missing and murdered
                indigenous women have reached crisis levels. Cheek was inspired to create a <q
                    person="#">“community action plan,”</q> a set of guidelines for local townships
                to address the problems that Native Americans face. It contains points like the need
                for a more responsive police force in cases of missing persons and human
                trafficking, of course, but also increased cultural education so youths <q
                    person="#">“know how to behave as a Dakota.”</q></p>
            <p>There is a section dedicated to teaching youths about trafficking and how they can
                protect themselves. Another asks for more intensive trauma training for those
                directly involved in such cases. Cheek’s main goal is to educate, a role she says
                she was born to do. As the Nashua camp seems likelier each day, it’s more important
                than ever for community members to brace for the future, Cheek said.</p>
            <p>“Our ancestors used to prepare for harsh winters to come, gathering berries and
                drying meat,” she said. <q person="#">“Today we have to keep our children safe, our
                    elders.”</q></p>
            <p>Indeed, the <org>Fort Peck Tribal Executive Board </org>does seem to be coming around
                to the concept. As of the council meeting on March 28, the leaders say they hope to
                implement an action plan similar to Cheek’s for speedier responses in the near
                future.</p>
            <p>For the Thunderchilds, life goes on, even if the family is shaken by the experience.
                    <person>Katie Thunderchild </person>has since doubled-down on her <q person="#"
                    >“mothering instinct,”</q> fearing for her daughters anytime they are left
                alone. Each day, local news highlights a missing woman, man or child, she said. What
                should she think if her daughters haven’t checked in within 20 minutes? An hour?
                With man camps so near, Thunderchild’s mind jumps to the worst.</p>
            <p>Prairiedawn and Tah’nee are all smiles now, beaming while they show off traditional
                regalia they have sewn themselves hanging from their bedroom walls. They debate with
                their mother about what to get for dessert at McDonald’s. A vanilla milkshake? No,
                no. Strawberry.</p>
            <p>But the events of that August evening stick like that rusty <state>North Dakota
                </state>mud. Worry turns to panic swiftly these days when the girls haven’t made
                recent contact, a feeling increasingly shared by others in the family.</p>
            <p><q person="#">“My grandmother’s like that,”</q> Thunderchild said. <q>“She’s always
                    been like that, but now it’s more.”</q></p>
            <p>So mom never lets them go anywhere, Tah’nee Thunderchild said with an understanding
                sigh. At least, not without following the rules. There are boundaries to where the
                sisters can walk alone. They must carry a cell phone at all times.</p>
            <p><q person="#">“We used to go for walks and nobody would bother us or anything until
                    that day,”</q>
                <person>Prairiedawn Thunderchild </person>said. But now, <q person="#">“we watch out
                    for men.”</q></p>
