# Midterm Progress Check

To start I had the layer that represents physical boundaries of the Native American Reservations based on the Living Atlas data I found. Which led me to map the Bureau of Justice Statistics crime data, this data includes a 5 year timespace (2010-2015), which led me to create a time layer within my map. I already had the petroleum and crude oil pipeline layers, so I added the ND Man Camp data from 2013 as well to show how the temporary work camps surround any ongoing pipeline projects. 


I still need to add more info to the Man Camp csv file to update my ArcGIS layer. Some updates include providing a year column and the name and/or street name of the location of the Temp Work Camp. I need to start the formatting for the Primary accounts layer from the data I collected from the newspaper articles.


Once all of the data within the csv files is finalized I will just need to make the layers aesthetically pleasing and functional based on the specific data of that layer within ArcGIS.
