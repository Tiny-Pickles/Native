# Project Name: NativeGone #

*Potential Names: (I want to think of a catchy name)*

## Inspirations: ##
Early on in college I took PLSC 123 Ethnic and Racial Politics class, and we briefly discussed current legislation and court rulings that have affected Native Americans within the US. I always found policies and legislation involving minority groups interesting. I hope this project will display the relationship the US government has with Native Americans and how our government to this day deals with certain minority groups. 
 
Last fall, I decided to take HIST 266Y Sex and Violence within the 19th century. In this class we talked about the sexual violence Native Americans have faced throughout US history and how it is still a significant problem to this day. I wanted to create this project to display these jarring statistics to try to help promote change. 
 
## Overview: ##
As a whole, minority groups have been oppressed throughout history. I have always been interested in the political climate and history that surround minority groups within the United States. One of the main goals of the NativeGone Project is to display the legal system that surrounds Native Americans. To this day, the United States government still treats Native Americans differently and that can be visible through past legislation and court cases. Reservations have a disproportionately higher crime rate and have a disproportionately higher portion of sexually related crimes. Another aspect I want to shine light on is the extremely high percent of sexual assault and rape crimes commited on Indian Reservations. This project will help to display and spread awareness about the current status of policies that affect Native Americans and Reservations. 
 
## Goals: ##
1. Create an Interactive Map of the United States listing all federally recognized Native American Agencies and Reservations. 
2. Create an Interactive Map that displays all sexually related crimes that involve Native Americans
    1. The focus of this map is to display statistics about sexual assault, rape, and missing person cases that occur on Native American Reservations still to this day.
3. Create a timeline of any significant court cases and legislation that have been involved within Native American politics. 
    1. The main goal of this timeline is to focus on specific events in history that have shown both oppressive and progressive actions of the US government toward Native Americans.

## Scope: ##
### Aspects of the Project That have a Larger Scope ###
My main goal is to complete and fine tune the map throughout the whole semester. I can make a rather large map with multiple layers because I have found good quality datasets that display the geographical location of Reservations, the extraction industry that overlap on Reservations, and all recorded/reported crimes that have occured within certain tribes on these Reservations. I can afford to create a rather larger map because I have the datasets to do so.
### Aspects of the Project That might have a Small Scope ###
The timeline however will only list significant events that have been involved in Native American Policy, with a focus on court decisions and legislation. I have to cut down the scope of my timeline due to the fact that Indian Law is very complicated. There are distinctions between criminal jurisdiction at all three levels of Indian Law. These levels include the Tribal courts, State courts, and Federal courts. Also there are many different factors that can affect cases that involve Tribal members. Some of these factors include whether a perpetrator is a Tribal member or a Non-Indian, or if the crime was committed on tribal land or outside of it. There are other factors I just listed a few. 

This will require intensive research that will take time, and I want to make sure my project is as historically accurate as possible. Also I will have to navigate around many legal documents and try to translate them for the average viewer of my site. It will take time to simplify complex legal jargon. Still I will try my best to group significant events to make a well rounded timeline throughout the whole semester. 
## Software and Technology: ##
The map will be constructed within [ArcGIS](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/get-started.htm). ArcGIS is a geographical information system software that is used to create 2D and 3D maps. ArcGIS is a tool used to create interactive maps that visualize and analyze data in various formats. For the NativeGone Project, I want to create a multi-layer 2D map of the United States that displays various information about Native Americans. 

These layers will included the following:
1. An interactive layer that displays the geographical location of all federally recognized Indian Reservations within the United States. 
    1. This layer will show the physical boundaries of all Indian Reservations and Agencies within the United States due to the fact that many reservations cross several state borders.
2. Another series of layers will display all Extractive Industries *(Crude Oil, Petroleum, Coal, etc.)*  that fall on federally recognized Reservations.
    1. This can be used to display a cause-and-effect analysis while comparing all Tribal Crimes across Tribal lands and how outside industry may or may not be a contributing factor to those statistics. 
    1. This This layer will show the dataset provided by [ArcGIS Living Atlas: Federally Recognized Tribal Reservations vs Oil/Petroleum/Coal Locations and Pipelines](https://pennstate.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cb42fa4c4b394bdeb8200fecb563ee22). 

The Documentational Timeline portion will use various markup languages including XML, XQuery, and RegEx. The timeline portion of the website will display significant court cases, and legislation pertaining to the criminal injustice of Native Americans. Also, this will show the ongoing flawed legal landscape that surrounds Native Americans.

For the Web development portion of the project, I will create and publish my site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I will be using other markup languages including HTML, and CSS for the basic structure of my site.

## NativeGone Project Timeline: ##
*This timeline is subjected to change in the future*

General order for Large Milestones within my Project
1. ArcGIS Map layers
2. Timeline of Significant Events 

Throughout this project I will work on some XML documents as well as webpages with HTML and CSS. Here is a link that will direct you to the project tab of my GitHub that will be a more specific [project timeline](https://github.com/Tiny-Pickles/NativeGone/projects/1). for various milestones. 


## Future Plans: ##

The hope for the NativeGone Project is for it to be used as a learning tool or resource for future Penn State classes or as a learning resource for Penn State students.
