# Project Name: NativeGone #

*Potential Names: (I want to think of a catchy name)*

## Inspirations: ##
Early on in college I took PLSC 123 Ethnic and Racial Politics class, and we briefly discussed current legislation and court rulings that have affected Native Americans within the US. I always found policies and legislation involving minority groups interesting. I hope this project will display the relationship the US government has with Native Americans and how our government to this day deals with certain minority groups. 
 
Last fall, I decided to take HIST 266Y Sex and Violence within the 19th century. In this class we talked about the sexual violence Native Americans have faced throughout US history and how it is still a significant problem to this day. I wanted to create this project to display these jarring statistics to try to help promote change.   
 
## Overview: ##
As a whole minority groups have been oppressed throughout history. Since the formation of the United States, white Americans have treated Native Americans as second-class citizens. The United States government still to this day treats Native Americans differently and the current situation and status of Agencies and Reservations reflect this. Reservations have a disproportionately higher crime rate and have a disproportionately higher portion of sexual driving crimes. The main goal of this project is to shine a light on the oppressive and progressive actions the US government has on Native Americans. 
 
## Goals: ##
1. Create an Interactive Map of the United States listing all federally recognized Native American Agencies and Reservations. 
2. Create an Interactive Map that displays all sexually driven crimes that involve Native Americans
    1. The focus of this map is to display statistics about sexual assault, rape, and missing person cases that occur on Native American Reservations still to this day.
3. Create a timeline of any significant court cases, legislation that have been involved within Native American politics. 
    1. The main goal of this timeline is to focus on specific events in history that have shown both oppressive and progressive actions of the US government toward Native Americans.

## Software and Technology: ##
The map will be constructed within [ArcGIS](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/get-started.htm). ArcGIS is a geographical information system software that is used to create 2D and 3D maps. ArchGIS is a tool used to create interactive maps that visualize and analyze data in various formats. For the NativeGone Project, I want to create a multi-layer 2D map of the United States that displays various information about Native Americans. 

These layers will included the following:
1.	An interactive layer that displays the geographical location of all federally recognized Indian Reservations within the United States. 
    1. a.	This layer will show the physical boundaries of all Indian Reservations and Agencies within the United States due to the fact that many reservations cross several state borders.
2. Another series of layers will display all Extractive Industries *(Crude Oil, Petroleum, Coal, etc.)*  that fall on federally recognized Reservations.
    1.a.	This layer will show the dataset provided by [ArcGIS Living Atlas: Federally Recognized Tribal Reservations vs Oil/Petroleum/Coal Locations and Pipelines](https://pennstate.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cb42fa4c4b394bdeb8200fecb563ee22). 

The Documentational Timeline portion will use various markup languages including XML, XQuery, and RegEx. The timeline portion of the website will display significant court cases, and legislation pertaining to the criminal injustice of Native Americans. Also, this will show the ongoing flawed legal landscape that surrounds Native Americans.

For the Web development portion of the project, I will create and publish my site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I will be using other markup languages including HTML, and CSS for the basic structure of my site.

## NativeGone Project Timeline: ##
*This timeline is subjected to change in the future*

Generally order for Large Milestones within my Project
1.	ArcGIS Map layers
2.	Timeline of Significant Events 

Throughout this project I will work on some xml documents as well as webpages with HTML and CSS. Here is a link that will direct you to the project tab of my GitHub that will be a more specific [project timeline](. (https://github.com/Tiny-Pickles/NativeGone/projects/1)) for various milestones. 

## Future Plans: ##

The hope for the NativeGone Project is for it to be used as a learning tool or resource for future Penn State classes or as a learning resource for Penn State students.
