"1/The figures shown in this column for the offense of rape were reported using only the revised Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) definition of rape. In 2013, the FBI's UCR Program initiated the collection of rape data within the Summary Reporting System under a revised definition. The term “forcible” was removed from the offense name, and the definition changed to the revised UCR definition below.  Revised UCR definition of rape:  Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2/Arson is not included in the property crime total in this table; however, if complete arson data were provided, it will appear in the arson column.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/The FBI does not publish arson data unless it receives data from either the agency for all 12 months of the calendar year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
