                    states. Originally, the first six states affected by this were California,
                    Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Alaska (after Alaska became a
                    state). Later on other states were allowed to transfer power if given consent

                <div class="title">Indian Civil Rights Act (1968)</div>
                <div class="secTitle">Background: </div>
                <div class="bodyText">The Indian Civil Rights Act allowed tribal governments to
                    adopt most of the rights found within the Bill of Rights. Not all provisions
                    from the Bill of Rights were found in the Indian Bill of Rights which was a part
                    of the Indian Civil Rights Act. Some exclusions included: the establishment
                    clause,the right to appoint counsel, the right to a grand jury, the indictment
                    requirement, and the right to a civil jury trial. There was also a sentence cap
                    within ICRA which only allowed tribes to sentence single offenders for a maximum
                    of six months in prison and or a fine of $500. The first Amendment to the Indian
                    Civil Rights Act was a part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act which helped increase the
                    sentencing cap for single offenders within tribal governments. The sentencing
                    cap for single offenders was now up to one year in prison and or a fine of
                    $5000. </div>
                <div class="secTitle">Impact: </div>
                <div class="bodyText">A maximum sentence cap puts severe limitations on tribal
                    government. This sentencing limit would often encourage criminal behavior in
                    some areas like Native American Reservation. The sentence cap did not pose a
                    real threat to offenders. </div>

                <div class="title">Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe (1978)</div>
                <div class="secTitle">Background: </div>
                <div class="bodyText">Mark David Oliphant was arrested and charged by tribal police
                    for assaulting a tribal police officer in August 1972. Mark Oliphant was a
                    permanent non-Indian resident living on the Port Madison Indian Reservation in
                    Washington. Also at the time of Oliphant’s arrest, the Suquamish Tribe’s Chief
                    Seattle Days celebration was going on. Tribal police knew that this celebration
                    would bring in lots of attention and people so the tribe requested additional
                    law enforcement assistance from both the county and the Bureau of Indian
                    affairs. Kitsap County ended up sending one deputy and the BIA did not send
                    anyone. During the time of Oliphant’s arrest tribal police were the only police
                    officers on duty. </div>
                <div class="secTitle">Ruling: </div>
                <div class="bodyText">This resulted in Oliphant applying for a writ of habeas corpus
                    because he was being tried under tribal law even though he was a non-Indian.
                    Habeas corpus defends individuals from wrongful imprisonment. Habeas corpus
                    orders that a public official deliver an imprisoned person to court to prove the
                    reasoning behind their imprisonment. The lower court rejected Oliphant’s
                    application with the reasoning to keep law and order on tribal lands and to
                    maintain tribal sovereignty. Oliphant appealed and his case evutallu reached the
                    U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Oliphant (6-2) stating
                    that tribal courts do not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. </div>
                <div class="secTitle">Impact: </div>
                <div class="bodyText">Tribal courts do not have criminal jurisdiction over
                    non-Indians. This causes a complex legal system in order to try perpetrators
                    within violent crime cases. </div>

                <div class="secTitle">Background: </div>
                <div class="bodyText">The Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 was the third amendment
                    to the Indian Civil Rights Act. This act helped to expand the sentencing
                    limitations of the Indian Civil Rights Act from one year to three year in prison
                    and or fines up to $15,000 for any defendant tried or convicted in tribal court. </div>
                <div class="secTitle">Impact: </div>
                <div class="bodyText">If a tribe decided to adopt TLOA, that tribe would need to
                    follow a checklist in order to implement enhanced sentencing within tribal
                    courts. These additional provisions include all due process protections listed
                    in TLOA, some of the provisions include the free, appointed licensed attorneys
                    for defendants, and a law trained judges, as well as the defendant should have
                    complete access to all existing tribal crime laws. This checklist can be rather
                    expensive to fund for tribal courts. As of 2019 only 16 out of the 319 federally
                    recognized tribal court systems have adopted TLOA’s enhanced sentencing. </div>

                <div class="title">The Violence Against Women Reauthoization Act (2013) </div>
                <div class="secTitle">Background: </div>
                <div class="bodyText">The original Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994 in
                    order to help improve criminal jurisdiction that surrounds sexual violence
                    committed against women. VAWA has been reauthorized 4 times since its creation.
                    The most recent was March 15, 2022. The second reauthorization of VAWA from 2005
                    was the first time the Act created a separate section that addressed safety for
                    Native American women. Under the third reauthorization of VAWA in 2013 it
                    expanded upon Title 9 Safety for Indian Women and authorized tribal jurisdiction
                    to prosecute non-Indians for domestic violence and dating violence. VAWA 2013
                    did not include tribal jurisdiction for non-Indian perpetrators that were
                    strangers. This act only included cvoerage for sexual violence commited by
                    intmate partners that were non-Indians On March 15 2022, President Biden signed
                    another Reauthorization of VAWA that expanded tribal jurisdiction even further
                    for Native American women. These additional categories include: domestic
                    violence, dating violence, sexual violence, stalking, sex trafficking, child
                    violence, obstruction of justice, and assaults against tribal justice
