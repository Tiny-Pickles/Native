                    <h2>Description:</h2>
                    <p>Sexual violence against Native American is a part of US history, and is not
                        well reported, is handled inconsistently in the US law and various levels of
                        government from tribal to federal courts. The NativeGone digital project
                        will map and visualize sexually related crimes that have impacted Native
                        American women during the time of the Bakken Oil Boom. During the Bakken Oil
                        Boom from 2006 to 2013, in North Dakota, Montana and parts of Canada. Native
                        American Reservations have a disproportionately higher crime rate and have a
                        disproportionately higher portion of sexually related crimes compared any
                        other racial group within the United States. This project will investigate
                        sexually related crimes committed on or near Native American Reservations
                        and the temporary work camps within the Extraction Industry during the
                        Bakken Boom. This project should help to show how the Extraction Industry
                        might have a correlation with an increase in tribal crime, specifically
                        sexually related crimes associated with Native American women. </p>

                    <h2>Objective: </h2>
                    <p>The main objective of the NativeGone project is to create an online website
                        that displays an interactive map and timeline. The map portion will focus on
                        displaying Native American Reservations within the states of North Dakota,
                        Montana, South Dakota, and Minnesota. There will be several interactive
                        layers that show various collections of data.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The geographical location of all federally recognized Native American
                            Reservations within the United States. This layer will show the physical
                            boundaries of all Reservations and Territories within the United States
                            because many reservations cross several state borders. </li>
                        <li>Extraction projects within the Crude Oil Industry during the Bakken Boom
                            that impact and or overlap on Native American Reservations. </li>
                        <li>All known locations of Temporary work camps within the state of North
                            Dakota during the peak of the Bakken Boom. </li>
                        <li>All available tribal crime data the relates to sexually driven crimes
                            that occur on Native American Reservations. These crimes would include
                            missing person reports, rape, sexual assault aggravated assault, etc. </li>
                        <li>Geodata drawn from primary accounts of anonymized Native American women
                            that have experienced sexual violence </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The project will also display a chronological timeline of court cases and
                        legislation that present the complex criminal jurisdiction that surrounds
                        Native Americans within the United States at all federal, state, and tribal
                        levels of government. This project will expose both the available data and
                        the gaps in the data reporting, to reveal how sexual violence remains a
                        problem for Native American women that is worsened by the presence of the
                        Extraction Industry. </p>
