            <h1>Inspirations:</h1>
            <div>Early on in college I took PLSC 123 Ethnic and Racial Politics class, and we
                briefly discussed current legislation and court rulings that have affected Native
                Americans within the US. I always found policies and legislation involving minority
                groups interesting. I hope this project will display the relationship the US
                government has with Native Americans and how our government to this day deals with
                certain minority groups.</div>
            <div>Last fall, I decided to take HIST 266Y Sex and Violence within the 19th century. In
                this class we talked about the sexual violence Native Americans have faced
                throughout US history and how it is still a significant problem to this day. I
                wanted to create this project to display these jarring statistics to try to help
                promote change. </div>

        <section class="overview">
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <div>As a whole minority groups have been oppressed throughout history. Since the
                formation of the United States, white Americans have treated Native Americans as
                second-class citizens. The United States government still to this day treats Native
                Americans differently and the current situation and status of Agencies and
                Reservations reflect this. Reservations have a disproportionately higher crime rate
                and have a disproportionately higher portion of sexual driving crimes. The main goal
                of this project is to shine a light on the oppressive and progressive actions the US
                government has on Native Americans.</div>

            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <dl>
                <dt>- Create an Interactive Map of the United States listing all federally
                    recognized Native American Agencies and Reservations.</dt>
                <dt>- Create an Interactive Map that displays all sexually driven crimes that
                    involve Native Americans</dt>
                <dd>- The focus of this map is to display statistics about sexual assault, rape, and
                    missing person cases that occur on Native American Reservations still to this
                    day.</dd>
                <dt>- Create a timeline of any significant court cases, legislation, and wars and
                    battles that have been involved within Native American politics.</dt>
                <dd>- The main goal of this timeline is to focus on specific events in history that
                    have shown both oppressive and progressive actions of the US government toward
                    Native Americans.</dd>
