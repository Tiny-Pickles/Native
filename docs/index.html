            <h2>Inspirations:</h2>
            <div class="paras">Early on in college I took PLSC 123 Ethnic and Racial Politics class,
                and we briefly discussed current legislation and court rulings that have affected
                Native Americans within the US. I always found policies and legislation involving
                minority groups interesting. I hope this project will display the relationship the
                US government has with Native Americans and how our government to this day deals
                with certain minority groups.</div>
            <div class="paras">Last fall, I decided to take HIST 266Y Sex and Violence within the
                19th century. In this class we talked about the sexual violence Native Americans
                have faced throughout US history and how it is still a significant problem to this
                day. I wanted to create this project to display these jarring statistics to try to
                help promote change. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="paras">As a whole minority groups have been oppressed throughout history. I
                have always been interested in the political climate and history that surround
                minority groups within the United States. One of the main goals of the NativeGone
                Project is to display the flawed legal system that surrounds Native Americans. To
                this day, the United States government still treats Native Americans differently and
                that can be visible through past legislation and court cases. Reservations have a
                disproportionately higher crime rate and have a disproportionately higher portion of
                sexually driving crimes. Another aspect I want to shine light on is the extremely
                high percent of sexual asualt and rape crimes commited on Indiain Reervastion. This
                project will help to display and spread awanwaress about the current status of
                Native American Policy and Reservations. </div>

        <div class="goals">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Create an Interactive Map of the United States listing all federally recognized
                    Native American Agencies and Reservations.</li>
                <li>Create an Interactive Map that displays all sexually driven crimes that involve
                    Native Americans 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The focus of this map is to display statistics about sexual assault,
                            rape, and missing person cases that occur on Native American
                            Reservations still to this day.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Create a timeline of any significant court cases, legislation, and wars and
                    battles that have been involved within Native American politics.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The main goal of this timeline is to focus on specific events in history
                            that have shown both oppressive and progressive actions of the US
                            government toward Native Americans.</li>
